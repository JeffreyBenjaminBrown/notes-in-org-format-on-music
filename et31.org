* scale concepts
** two stacks of fifths
* nice chords
** 0 25 40
** wide whole tone: 0 6 11 17 22 28
subset: 0 11 17 28
** 17_ 23_ 0 8 14
This is symmetric -- -14 -8 0 8 14.
** using 0 11 22 as an extension
0 18 25+[0,11,22] = [0,18,25,5',16']
  In 12ET that would be a 7#11.
  Works with a 3rd of 7 (m3) or 10 (M3).
** (0 18 25) + (7' + (0 8 18 28))
The second chord is a min major 7th starting at 7,
that is a short minor 3rd above the octave of the power-7 chord below.
(where a power-7 chord is 0 18 25, i.e. it's got harmonics 3 and 7).
** maj 7 under a min 7
In 12et it would be:
  (0 7  11)  (3 7  10)'
In 31et:
  (0 18 28)  (7 18 25)'
* nice changes
** two minor chords, descending 4/31 from one to the other
but holding the fifth degree (18/31) from the first,
and between them play the dominant (major starting at 18) chord of the first.
